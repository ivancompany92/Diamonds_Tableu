#### Ivan Company

#### Data Analytics Bootcamp - Project module 2


## **Overview**
In this project, we have analyzed in depth the data contained in our file "diamonds_train.csv" to better understand how to know the price of a diamond for its different qualities and dimensions. 

And we will also be better prepared to win the competition of module 3 !!


## **Data**

* [.csv Dataset](http://www.potacho.com/files/ironhack/diamonds_train.csv)

The dataset is the diamonds_train.csv file, with ten columns where you can see all the information about each diamond. 

We have 40.455 diamonds in our csv.


## **Requirements**
You need to have Python installed with the following libraries:
   - Pandas
    
   - matplotlib.pyplot

   - plotly.express 
    
   - seaborn


You have more information in the file: requirements.txt

## **Analysis with Tableu**
After analyzing and understanding how the price of a diamond changes, we have created an interactive dashboard in Tableau. 

You can see it at the following link:

## **Hypothesis Testing**
We have performed 2 tests to learn more about our diamond database. In the first, we have tested whether the prices in our sample are significantly different from 4000. In the second, we have tested whether the group 1 of diamonds (Very Good cut + color I) is significantly different from the group 2(Very Good cut + color J).

## **Next steps:**
- We can analyze how the price varies based on two or more variables simultaneously, to better understand how to set the price of a diamond.
